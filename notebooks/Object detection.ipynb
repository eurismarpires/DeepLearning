You saw that while traditional programming was inadequate for classifying images, deep learning makes it not only possible, but fairly straightforward. You can now create an image classifier *when given a deep neural network and thousands of labeled images.* \n",
    "\n",
    "You then explored how you could improve your model. You increased its confidence and accuracy by running more epochs, adding more data, and being thoughtful about which network was best for your data. You expanded the types of digits your model could classify by augmenting images prior to training to represent a more diverse dataset. \n",

    "\n",
    "The fact that we used a sliding window with non-overlapping grid squares means that it is very likely that some of our grid squares will only partially contain a whale face and this can lead to misclassifications. However, as we increase the overlap in the grid squares we will rapidly increase the computation time for this sliding window approach. We can make up for this increase in computation by *batching* inputs, a strategy that takes advantage of the GPU's intrinsic strength of parallel processing.\n",
